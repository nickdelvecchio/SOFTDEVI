The file moved from the main repository to a sub repository.

What happened?

The file got moved again through the workflow.

Is the new directory present?

Yes

How many files of the "questions.txt" are present?

1

Explained why you think it happened?

I think it happened because we just transferred the file from one part of the repository to another. Thus, since we didn't copy it, it only came up with 1 file.
